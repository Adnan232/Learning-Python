Norse deity Loki is infamously known as a god of mischief. So when Marvel's version headlines his own show, a delicious streak of trickery will obviously run through the action. Tom Hiddleston is the perfect lead for this riotously imaginative new series, possibly the weirdest adventure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet. Loki premieres today, June 9, on Disney Plus, with a new episode streaming each week.

The series opens with a scene from Avengers: Endgame, in which Marvel's mightiest heroes have time-traveled back to the events of the first Avengers movie and bumped into the God of Mischief when he was still the scamp we first met all those years ago. This past Loki hasn't sought redemption for his villainy because that stuff hasn't happened yet. So when this Loki scoops up a stray magical cube and uses it to escape, he sets the past on a different path. This brings him to the attention of a previously unseen agency of timecops, all set to wipe everyone's favorite demented deity from existence -- unless he turns out to be the key to a time-bending threat that could rewrite the entire MCUâ€¦ 
From this opening scene, the show immediately takes a sharp turn away from you might expect from a Marvel story. Not only that, but it sets out its stall with a glorious visual that involves, perhaps appropriately, Loki getting punched in the face.

Director Kate Herron continues this quirky and audacious visual style as the series soars into boldly imaginative new directions. This is very much not the meat-and-potatoes superhero action of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. And if anything it has potential to get weirder than WandaVision.That's the foundation of the show's appeal: It is uncharted territory. WandaVision drew us in with its mystery element, which the very familiar Falcon and Winter Soldier entirely lacked. Loki takes WandaVision's weirdness and pushes even further into a whole new myth of the MCU that feels big enough to completely shake up the whole Marvel thing (unlike previous Marvel TV shows, which were precision-engineered to not affect the big screen story at all). After a decade, it's thrilling to see there are still some surprises in the MCU.
